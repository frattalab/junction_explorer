So you want to make some plots. And the splice junctions we hosted at Shiny.IO didn't cut it. 

If we could have freely made all the junctions available, we would have, but the full NYGC dataset is something like 5GB and the RiMOD over a gig as well, and free things have limits. 

But do not fear! You are an intrepid traveller and you're willing to try and deploy this app on your desktop

You can download and unzip the full parquet files for NYGC from here:
10.5281/zenodo.15977268

You are going to download this GitHub repo (this one, where we are, right now)

You are going to upzip those folders



Test on, say, the annotated version of the STMN2 cryptic exon
`chr8:79611214-79636802` which won't show up in the hosted version
